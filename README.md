# Fiber Network Database with MySQL

This project demonstrates how to connect to a **MySQL** database using **Python**. It includes the creation of tables and sample data for managing **structures**, **cards**, and **fiber connections** in a fiber network infrastructure. The project uses the `mysql-connector-python` library to interact with the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:

- **MySQL Server** running and accessible.
- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **MySQL Connector** library installed.

### Install MySQL Connector

To connect to MySQL from Python, you'll need to install the MySQL connector:
